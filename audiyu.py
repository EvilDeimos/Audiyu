        Welcome to Audiyu manual!
        So here is the complete how to- documentation to guide you to use this software
        
        I. Decrypt and remove PDF's password
            
            Basically this feature is going to remove your pdf's password forever. 
        So you won't need to insert the password over and over again. This feature
        meant to make your day easier, writer not responsible about the misleading 
        of Audiyu's usage.
        
        Example of usage:
        0. Install the required library through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
        1. Start the program, open cmd or other command liner on that folder and 
           type 'python audiyu.py'
        2. Choose number 1 and press enter
        3. Insert the file name complete with the extension (.pdf), make sure it's 
           a pdf file and in the same folder with Audiyu
        4. Enter the password, it will show you the total page and check your folder,
           there will be a new pdf file with the same pdf's name but has a 'dec' name
        5. You can rename it later.
        
        II. PDF to Mp3 converter
        
            This feature has ability to convert PDF into a Mp3, so you can get a 
        audiobook version of your pdf for free. Currently the supported languange 
        is english. Later on, we will provide more languange. The speech machine is
        using a google translate's library (gTTS or google text to speech). As you 
        know that gTTS will convert text to speech, so first thing before convert it
        is to extract each word in the pdf file. 
        
        Example of usage:
        0. Install the required library through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
        1. Start the program, open cmd or other command liner on that folder and 
           type 'python audiyu.py'
        2. Choose number 2 and press enter
        3. Insert the file name complete with the extension (.pdf), make sure it's 
           a pdf file and in the same folder with Audiyu. MAKE SURE IT'S NOT ENCRYPTED
        4. Insert the starting point of the PDF
        5. You'll need to choose custom endpoint or the rest of the page. If you want
           custom endpoint press 1 and press enter, if you want the rest of the book 
           than press 2 and enter. If you choose to, skip to step 7.
        6. Insert the custom endpoint. Make sure it's a number
        7. Insert the name of the Mp3 File, no need to type the .mp3 extension
        8. Please wait patiently until the program is done.
        
        III. Music Player
        
            To be honest this third feature is only a just for fun project because
        it's so simple to code and we believe that users will use another music player.
        So, don't complain lol.
        
        Example of usage:
        0. Install the required library through 'pip install -r requirements.txt'
        1. Start the program, open cmd or other command liner on that folder and 
           type 'python audiyu.py'
        2. Choose number 3 and press enter
        3. Insert the .mp3 file. Make sure you write the .mp3 extension
        4. The audio file will automatically played
        5. press 'p' and enter to pause, press 'r' and enter to resume, and press 
           'e' and enter to exit
        
        IV. Conclusion
        
            Audiyu is suitable for people that more comfortable to hearing than reading.
        Audiyu is suitable for people that more comfortable to not spend any money :D.
